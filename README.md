# Market Concentration
Recently (at the time of this Readme 06/25/2023 18:31) there has been a noticeable difference between larger cap companies outperforming smaller cap companies. This is particularly of focus since common market indices (SPX, NASDAQ, and others) are cap weighted. This analysis will look at the spread between cap weighted SPX and equal weighted SPX and attempt to describe the market effects of this difference.

Ultimately it is found that smaller cap index members tend to “catch-up” to their larger cap members historically.
