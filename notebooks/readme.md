# Returns Playback (Z-Score entry)

We Can use a z-score trigger as a buy in period. In this case we'll use 2 as our buy in period and then hold for 3 months. We'll just be long the various small caps indices.

Their returns played back over the z-score trigger are

Suprisingly they did well. I think with simple drawdown and risk limits we can bring returns even higher without heavy optimization. 

To do
1. Comparative index return
2. Sharpe, alpha, beta
3. L/S
4. drawdown & risk limits
5. static z-score exit
6. dynamic z-score
